# Hello! 👋I'm Jordan Schatz

## 👨‍💻About Me

I am a software engineer and entrepreneur. Previously I've been a CTO (multiple
times), lead developer, consultant, ran my own software agency (twice), been a
dev-ops consultant, worked in multiple startups, and ran a non-tech business.

I, my wife, and six kids live in a yurt, in the mountains of Montana. We also
like to travel extensively.

I like to discuss technology and business, if you want, drop me a line at
jordan@noionlabs.com.
