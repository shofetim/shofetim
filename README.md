# Hello! 👋I'm Jordan Schatz

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a software engineer and entrepreneur. Previously I've been CTO (multiple
times), lead developer, consultant, ran my own software agency (twice), done
DevOps consulting, worked in multiple startups, and ran a non-tech business.

I, my wife, and six kids live off grid, in a yurt, in the mountains of Montana.
We also like to travel extensively.

I like to discuss technology and business, if you want, drop me a line at
jordan@jordanschatz.com.


## 🔧 Tech

I've worked professionally in many languages (PHP, Python, Clojure, Clojure
Script, Javascript (server and client), Go, Racket, Schema, Janet, Rust and more.)

These days I am focusing on Rust, building high performance system level
software and web back ends. I also occasionally take on projects in C, Python,
Javascript & Janet.

## 🧙‍♂️ Consulting

I do [DevOps, cloud, and performance consulting
work](https://jordanschatz.com/), and I'd love to hear about your project. I
tend to have a waiting list, so it may be a few months before I could address it
though.
